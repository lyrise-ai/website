        Each neuron receives input, applies a mathematical transformation, and
        passes the output to the next layer. This structure allows neural
        networks to learn from vast amounts of data, making them incredibly
        powerful for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing,
        and even playing complex games. As technology advances, the potential
        applications of neural networks continue to expand, promising exciting
        developments in various fields.
